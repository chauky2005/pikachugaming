# Pikachu Game Simulation

## Overview

This project is a simulation of the classic Pikachu tile-matching game. It was developed as part of a course assignment and offers three difficulty levels to challenge the playerâ€™s logical thinking and reaction speed.

## Features

- **Three Difficulty Levels:**
  - **Easy:** Standard gameplay with no additional constraints.
  - **Normal:** Introduces movement limitations or time constraints.
  - **Difficult:** Players must input the index of a previously removed column to proceed with certain actions, simulating a more complex environment.

- **Interactive Gameplay:**
  - Visual display of a grid filled with Pikachu tiles.
  - Players select two matching tiles that can be connected with at most three straight lines.
  - Removed tiles disappear from the board after a valid match.

- **Victory Condition:**
  - The game ends successfully when all matching tiles are cleared.

## How to Play

1. Launch the program.
2. Select your desired difficulty level.
